# Kirby CMS - Generate .ics files for your structured fields

This only works once you've installed [Texnixe's kirby-structure-id plugin](https://github.com/texnixe/kirby-structure-id) and have fully initialized it (_i.e._ created the UID fields).

Once this is done, add the code from each of these files to their respective place in your own kirby installation.
